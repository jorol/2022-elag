## VM

For this tutorial we need some command-line tools to process MARC data. You can download a [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) image containing the required tools here: [elag.ova](https://jorol.de/elag/elag.ova) (MD5 checksum "cf78157c0e0e9e4af00fd1d991831701", user "elag", password "elag"). Please follow the installation instructions at the [Catmandu](https://librecatproject.wordpress.com/get-catmandu/) project site (skip "1. Download the Catmandu-Eddie.ova image").

Please make sure to set right keyboard layout for your computer. You can add layouts via "Menu -> Settings -> Keyboard -> Layout". Use the "+ ADD" button to add your layout. Use the "â†‘" button to move your preferred layout to the top of the list of layouts. You can switch between layouts by clicking the flag icon on the right side of the top menu.
